This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the order of script and HTML elements.  The initial `bug.html` file contains a script that attempts to modify the content of a div element. However, due to the script's placement *before* the div, the script fails because the div element does not exist yet when the script runs. The solution demonstrates the correct way to place the script element, ensuring it finds the div element. This highlights the importance of correct HTML element ordering for the proper functioning of dynamic content.
